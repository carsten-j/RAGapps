The first property mentioned is the NIKE World Campus in Beaverton, Oregon, USA. It says they occupy approximately 11,400 employees and manage various functions like management, research, design, etc.\\n\\nThen there\\'s a smaller administrative facility in Hilversum, Netherlands, which serves as headquarters for Europe, Middle East & Africa. Next, under \"Operations,\" it mentions an office complex in Shanghai, China, serving Greater China geography with employees focused on implementing their operations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the context talks about distribution centers in the United States: five near Memphis, two owned and three leased; one in Indianapolis and one in Dayton, both leased by logistics providers. There\\'s also a distribution center in Ontario, California, which is leased for Converse. Outside the U.S., there are facilities in Laakdal.\\n\\nSo, looking at all this information, I see that Nike does lease an office complex in Shanghai, China.
